# To Do Application ðŸ“šâœ…

## ðŸ”¥ðŸš€ What is this project about?

The project consists in a simple To Do List, when users can create, update, read and delete their tasks, but not other users tasks. And admins can see all tasks and manage them. <br/>

My goal with this project was to **learn and improve my skills** with the following technologies:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Flyway Migrations
- Unit Tests with JUnit and Mockito.
